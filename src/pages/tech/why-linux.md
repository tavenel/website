title: Why using Linux ?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is highly configurable and that can run on mostly everything.

The ability to fully adapt your system to your liking is the real killer for me.

## My personal history with Linux

For now almost 20 years, I have been a huge fan of the GNU/Linux ecosystem.

I really tend to switch from one distribution to another every couple of years, as I like experimenting with them

### Debian

I started using [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) in a VirtualBox VM when I was in high school - not an easy

### Ubuntu

I then moved for a short time to [Ubuntu](), experimenting with both [Gnome]() and [KDE]() but I have never really been a big fan of this distribution - too many things running in the background, installing a package could hang for ages if you hit a concurrent upgrade, ...

### Arch

[Arch]() seems to have become the new go-to distribution for all the geeks around. I have never really used it for long enough (don't know why) to say anything about it.

### Gentoo

### Alpine Linux

I started using [Alpine Linux]() only two years ago.

### Custom distro

After I successfully crashed my system and managed to destroy the backup too, I moved back to standard Alpine (time to go fresh anyway).

### Now

Alpine is currently (09/2022) my daily driver. It is running as a RAM-based system from a USB key.
I may or may not try to clean my Alpine distro (remove kernel modules and compile firmwares in a minimal kernel, remove unused firmwares, write new minimal init) but I also like the idea of having my whole generic system on a 4GB USB key that I can bring everywhere.

I also have a Windows install that I must access once or twice a year for work-related reasons - enough to remember why I don't like it.

## Conclusion

So, is Linux the Perfect Operating System ?

In my views, far from it.

I used Solaris (a POSIX system derived from the BSDs) when I worked at Oracle and I do miss both the robustness of the system and the level of segmentation in the network stack. The formal aspect of the BSDs , while offering less recent features, is far less of a mess than the GNU/Linux ecosystems.

Windows is now running Linux kernels with WSL, Android is still really close to Linux, which means better systems compatibility but using a single system implementation will lack the ingenuity of the others (yes, even Windows).

I am also amased by the progress some distributions have done in the past few years to ease the newcomers to Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora) but I fear this may start a new trend for bloated systems that are easy to use.
Using a less trivial Linux distribution requires you to dig into config files and understand how the system works, and you will spend hours figuring how to fix this or that issue. But the power you get from this understanding of your system is certainly worth it.

That said, I will certainly continue using Linux for a long time - and you ?
